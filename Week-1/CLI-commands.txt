Command line interface (cli): is a way of interacting with your computer.


Command line operators: 
there is two handy and powerful operators you can use in the command line interface the ( > , |) operators.
1-( > ) the greater than operator: this operator is used to redirect output from one command into another 
ex: if you want to use (ls –l) to display a list of files but you want to put this list in a file instead of listing it 
in the command line screen, you can redirect the output from the (ls –l) command into the input of other command by using the > character: (ls –l > filename).
2-( | ) the vertical line operator: lets you chain commands together into much more powerful commands 
ex: if you want to use (ls –l) to display a list of files but it keeps scrolling off the screen,
 you can pipe the output from the (ls –l) command into the input of the more command by using the | character(ls -l | more).


Using Aliases:
Aliases save you loads of time by shortening long, complicated commands down into really simple 
ones, or by setting the default parameters to a command so you don't have to type them every time. 
For instance, if you wanted to make shortcuts for most commands you use but they are too long and takes time so you use this alias ex: alias ls=’ls –l’.
